<p>He had a dog named Sparky, he had an unnamed cat that went berserk in "Cat Soup," and a sister who was accidentally run over by Anthony in "Ian's Birthday." 
<p>Although he is best friends with Anthony in real life and almost every Smosh video, they are both portrayed as mortal enemies in the Food Battle series. It is because Anthony thinks Ian's pink-frosted sprinkled donuts are useless, and he says that his taquitos, celeries, churros, burritos, red hot chili peppers, rainbow lollipops, egg rolls, giant gummy snakes, rock candies, chocolate-coated bananas, and vegan pink-frosted sprinkled donuts are much better. </p>

<h2><u>Anthony Padilla</u></h2>
